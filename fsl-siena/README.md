Build context for a Flywheel Gear to execute FSL's SIENA.

This Gear uses two high-resolution T1 image (either in NII or NII.GZ) to estimates percentage brain volume change (PBVC) betweem two input images, taken of the same subject, at different points in time. It calls a series of FSL programs to strip the non-brain tissue from the two images, register the two brains (under the constraint that the skulls are used to hold the scaling constant during the registration) and analyse the brain change between the two time points. It is also possible to project the voxelwise atrophy measures into standard space in a way that allows for multi-subject voxelwise statistical testing. An extension for ventricular analysis is provided in FSL5.
